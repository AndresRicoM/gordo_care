If you are planning on taking him out on a longer walk, you can use his stroller. He can walk for 15 minutes and then hop on the stroller.

**CAUTION** When walking, always take water and be checking that his temperature and breathing are normal. This breed is very sensitive to heat shock so its good to exagerate in keeping him cool and calm.

## Skin 
If any rash or bald spot appears, apply a little bit of Barmicil on the spot once per day until you see it go away.

    - Allow him to grab rope and try to pull it from you. 
    - Don't pull very hard as it can damage his teeth. 
    - Give space between your hand and his mouth so he does'nt accidentaly bite you while playing. 
- Chase the ball
    - Ahow him tennis ball. Tease him with it but don't let him grab it.

## Emergency
- Something in his mouth that should not be there (food, metal objects, pointy objects, plastics)
    - Distract him with a treat and grab the object while he goes for the treat. If he doesn't leave the object, look for a more interesting treat. In majot cases, you can put his food plate with a scoop of food and he will leave the object.

## Playful emergencies

### Stealing Objects
Aitor might grab a towel, shoe or other fun objects to play with you. If he grabs anything that he should not have grabbed, do not attempt to take it away from him. He can bite. Instead, distract him with a treat. You can oplace the treat one meter away and he will eventually leave the object and grab the treat. You can grab the object while he goes for the treat. 

### Barking at you while eating
If he barks at you while sitting down, it might be a sign that he wants to play. You can refer to the three types of play that he likes. Playing for 10-15 will drain a lot of his energy and he'll go back to his bed. 

### Bitting his bed and blanket
If he bites his bed and/or blanket. You can distract him and lay the blanket nicely on his bed. This will make him go to bed again. You can also put the blanket on him and he will lay down.


## Bad Behavior

### Continuouslu Barking at humans
You can play with him, give him treats and distract him. If he continues to bark, you can put him in his bed and cover him with his blanket. He will eventually go to sleep.

### Biting hands
Don't attempt to take away a ball or food that is in his mouth. He can bite. If he shows intention to bite remove hand immedeately and say a firm no. If he continues you can walk away from him. He usually bites if he is under stress or if he wants to be left alone. 

### Biting feet
He can bite your feet before going on a walk. This will only occur when he is crossing the door. To avoid this, you can [put his vest on while he is eating](#walks). If he has the vest on after eating, he will be ready to go for a walk calmly. 

If he randomly bites feet, stay calm, pull feet away and say no firmly. His bite is never strong nor with the goal of hurting. 

The best way to make him stop any bad behavior is to distract him with another thing. It can be a toy, a treat or a walk.
